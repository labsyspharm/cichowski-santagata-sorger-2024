## SUMMARY
Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive breast cancer subtype and has the	highest rate of recurrence1. The predominant standard of care for advanced TNBC is systemic chemotherapy with or without immunotherapy, however responses are typically short-lived. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop more effective treatments. PI3K pathway components represent plausible therapeutic targets, as at least 70% of TNBCs have PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN alterations3â€“6. However, unlike hormone receptor-positive tumors, it is still unclear if or how PI3K pathway inhibitors will be effective in triple-negative disease. Here we describe a promising AKT inhibitor-based therapeutic combination for TNBC. Specifically, we show that AKT inhibitors potently synergize with agents that suppress the histone methyltransferase, EZH2, and promote robust tumor regression in multiple TNBC models in vivo. AKT and EZH2 inhibitors exert these effects by first cooperatively driving basal-like TNBC cells into a more differentiated, luminal-like	state, which cannot be effectively induced by either agent alone. Once differentiated, these agents kill TNBCs by hijacking signals that normally drive mammary gland involution. Importantly, using a machine learning approach we developed a classifier that can be used to predict sensitivity.	Together these findings identify a promising therapeutic strategy for this highly aggressive tumor type and illustrate how deregulated epigenetic enzymes can insulate tumors from oncogenic vulnerabilities. These studies also reveal how developmental tissue-specific cell death pathways may be co-opted for therapeutic benefit.


## ACCESS THE DATA

## Codes for imaging data processing
High-plex whole-slide images were acquired using tissue cyclic immunofluorescence (t-CyCIF; Lin et al, 2018) and then stitched and registered using ASHLAR (https://github.com/labsyspharm/ashlar).
